Files are of the format <network_provider>-uplink.rx or <network_provider>-downlink.rx. Each uplink-downlink pair corresponds to saturating the uplink and the downlink on a network provider simultaneously. Different network providers were saturated at different times. The timestamps are Unix timestamps in nanoseconds and log the time at which packets were received. The timestamps are likely to be accurate to around one millisecond.
